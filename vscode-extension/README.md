# Visual Studio Code Extension for Groovy

A sample extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) based on the [Groovy Language Server](https://github.com/prominic/groovy-language-server).

> Note: There are no plans to release this extension to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace for easy installation. Additionally, it's unlikely that any new features will be added to the extension. It is indented to be a barebones sample only, and the goal is simply to show how it might be integrated into an editor, rather than to create a fully featured extension for real-world development.

## Build

To build from the command line, run the following command:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

The extension will be created in the _build_ folder.
